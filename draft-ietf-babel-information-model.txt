                 draft-ietf-babel-information-model-04

Abstract

   This Babel Information Model can be used to create data models under
   various data modeling regimes (e.g., YANG).  It allows a Babel
   implementation (via a management protocol such as NETCONF) to report
   on its current state and may allow some limited configuration of
   protocol constants.

1.  Introduction

   Babel is a loop-avoiding distance-vector routing protocol defined in
   [I-D.ietf-babel-rfc6126bis].  [I-D.do-babel-hmac] defines a security
   mechanism that allows Babel messages to be cryptographically
   authenticated, and [I-D.decimo-babel-dtls] defines a security
   mechanism that allows Babel messages to be encrypted.  This document
   describes an information model for Babel (including implementations
   using one of these security mechanisms) that can be used to created
   management protocol data models (such as a NETCONF [RFC6241] YANG
   [RFC7950] data model).

   Due to the simplicity of the Babel protocol, most of the information
   model is focused on reporting status of the Babel protocol, and very
   little of that is considered mandatory to implement (conditional on a
   management protocol with Babel support being implemented).  Some
   parameters may be configurable; however, it is up to the Babel
   implementation whether to allow any of these to be configured within
   its implementation.  Where the implementation does not allow
   configuration of these parameters, it may still choose to expose them
   as read-only.

Internet-Draft           Babel Information Model            October 2018


   The Information Model is presented using a hierarchical structure.
   This does not preclude a data model based on this Information Model
   from using a referential or other structure.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119] and updated
   by [RFC8174].

1.2.  Notation

   This document uses a programming language-like notation to define the
   properties of the objects of the information model.  An optional
   property is enclosed by square brackets, [ ], and a list property is
   indicated by two numbers in angle brackets, <m..n>, where m indicates
   the minimal number of values, and n is the maximum.  The symbol * for
   n means no upper bound.

   The object definitions use base types that are defined as follows:

   base64      An opaque array of bytes.

   boolean     A type representing a boolean value.

   counter     A non-negative integer that monotonically increases.
               Counters may have discontinuities and they are not
               expected to persist across restarts.

   credentials An opaque type representing credentials needed by a
               cryptographic mechanism to secure communication.  Data
               models must expand this opaque type as needed and
               required by the security protocols utilized.

   datetime    A type representing a date and time using the Gregorian
               calendar.  The datetime format MUST conform to RFC 3339
               [RFC3339].

   int         A type representing signed or unsigned integer numbers.
               This information model does not define a precision nor
               does it make a distinction between signed and unsigned
               number ranges.

   ip-address  A type representing an IP address.  This type supports
               both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.

Internet-Draft           Babel Information Model            October 2018


   string      A type representing a human-readable string consisting of
               a (possibly restricted) subset of Unicode and ISO/IEC
               10646 [ISO.10646] characters.

   uri         A type representing a Uniform Resource Identifier as
               defined in STD 66 [RFC3986].

2.  Overview

   The Information Model is hierarchically structured as follows:

   information object
      includes implementation version, router id, this node seqno,
        enable flag parameters, supported security mechanisms
      constants object (exactly one per information object)
         includes UDP port and optional multicast group
           parameters
      interfaces object
         includes interface reference, Hello seqno and intervals,
           update interval, link type, external cost parameters
         neighbors object
            includes neighbor IP address, Hello history, cost
              parameters
         security object (per interface)
            includes enable flag, self credentials (credential
              object), trusted credentials (credential object)
      security object (common to all interfaces)
         includes enable flag, self credentials (credential
           object), trusted credentials (credential object)
      routes object
         includes route prefix, source router, reference to
           advertising neighbor, metric, sequence number, whether
           route is feasible, whether route is selected

   Following is a list of the data elements that an implementation can
   choose to allow to be configurable:

   o  enable/disable babel

   o  Constant: UDP port

   o  Constant: IPv6 multicast group

   o  Interface: Link type

   o  Interface: External cost (must be configurable if implemented, but
      implementation is optional)

   o  Interface: enable/disable babel on this interface

   o  Interface: enable/disable message log

   o  Security: enable/disable this security mechanism

   o  Security: self credentials

   o  Security: trusted credentials

   o  Security: enable/disable security log

   Note that this overview is intended simply to be informative and is
   not normative.  If there is any discrepancy between this overview and
   the detailed information model definitions in subsequent sections,
   the error is in this overview.

   babel-supported-link-types:  set of values of supported link types;
      valid enumeration values are identified in Babel Link Types
      registry (see Section 7)

   babel-self-seqno:  the current sequence number included in route
      updates for routes originated by this node

      computation algorithms; possible values include "k-out-of-j",
      "ETX"

   babel-security-supported:  list of supported security mechanisms; as
      babel security mechanisms are defined, they will need to indicate
      what enumeration value is to be used to represent them in this
      parameter

   babel-constants:  a babel-constants-obj object

   babel-interfaces:  a set of babel-interface-obj objects

   babel-security:  a babel-security-obj object that applies to all
      interfaces; if this object is implemented, it allows a security
      mechanism to be enabled or disabled in a manner that applies to
      all Babel messages on all interfaces

   babel-routes:  a set of babel-route-obj objects; includes received
      and routes routes

3.2.  Definition of babel-constants-obj

        object {

   babel-interface-reference:  reference to an interface object as
      defined by the data model (e.g., YANG [RFC7950], BBF TR-181); data
      model is assumed to allow for referencing of interface objects
      which may be at any layer (physical, Ethernet MAC, IP, tunneled
      IP, etc.); referencing syntax will be specific to the data model;
      if there is no set of interface objects available, this should be
      a string that indicates the interface name used by the underlying
      operating system

   babel-interface-enable:  if true, babel sends and receives messages
      on this interface; if false, babel messages received on this
      interface are ignored and none are sent; MAY be configurable

   babel-link-type:  indicates the type of link; valid enumeration
      values are identified in Babel Link Types registry; MAY be
      configurable

   babel-mcast-hello-seqno:  the current sequence number in use for
      multicast hellos sent on this interface

   babel-mcast-hello-interval:  the current interval in use for
      multicast hellos sent on this interface

   babel-update-interval:  the current interval in use for all updates
      (multicast and unicast) sent on this interface

   babel-external-cost:  external input to cost of link of this
      interface; if supported, this is a value that is added to the
      metrics of routes learned over this interface; how an
      implementation uses the value is up to the implementation, which
      means the use may not be consistent across implementations; MUST
      be configurable if implemented

   babel-message-log-enable:  if true, logging of babel messages
      received on this interface is enabled; if false, babel messages
      are not logged; MUST be configurable, if implemented

   babel-message-log:  log entries that have timestamp of a received
      Babel message and the entire received Babel message (including
      Ethernet frame and IP headers, if possible); an implementation
      must restrict the size of this log, but how and what size is
      implementation-specific; if this log is implemented, a mechanism
      to clear it SHOULD be provided

   babel-neighbors:  a set of babel-neighbors-obj objects

   babel-interface-security:  a babel-security-obj object that applies
      to this interface; if implemented, this allows security to be
      enabled only on specific interfaces or allows different security
      mechanisms to be enabled on different interfaces

3.4.  Definition of babel-neighbors-obj

         }babel-neighbors-obj;

   babel-neighbor-address:  (IPv4 or v6) address the neighbor sends
      messages from

   babel-hello-mcast-history:  the multicast Hello history of whether or
      not the multicast Hello messages prior to babel-exp-mcast-hello-
      seqno were received; representation of a binary sequence where the
      most recently received Hello is expressed as a "1" placed in the
      left-most bit, with prior bits shifted right (and "0" bits placed
      between prior Hello bits and most recent Hello for any not-
      received Hellos); represented as a string using utf-8 encoded hex
      digits ([0-9a-fA-F]); note that this representation (supplied to a
      user interface or transmitted across a management interface) is a
      string representation of the stored binary value; see
      [I-D.ietf-babel-rfc6126bis], section A.1

   babel-hello-ucast-history:  the unicast Hello history of whether or
      not the unicast Hello messages prior to babel-exp-mcast-hello-
      seqno were received; representation of a binary sequence where the
      most recently received Hello is expressed as a "1" placed in the
      left-most bit, with prior bits shifted right (and "0" bits placed
      between prior Hello bits and most recent Hello for any not-

      user interface or transmitted across a management interface) is a
      string representation of the stored binary value; see
      [I-D.ietf-babel-rfc6126bis], section A.1

   babel-txcost:  transmission cost value from the last IHU packet
      received from this neighbor, or maximum value (infinity) to
      indicates the IHU hold timer for this neighbor has expired

   babel-exp-mcast-hello-seqno:  expected multicast Hello sequence
      number of next Hello to be received from this neighbor; if
      multicast Hello messages are not expected, or processing of
      multicast messages is not enabled, this MUST be 0

   babel-exp-ucast-hello-seqno:  expected unicast Hello sequence number
      of next Hello to be received from this neighbor; if unicast Hello
      messages are not expected, or processing of unicast messages is
      not enabled, this MUST be 0

   babel-ucast-hello-seqno:  the current sequence number in use for
      unicast hellos sent to this neighbor

   babel-ucast-hello-interval:  the current interval in use for unicast
      hellos sent to this neighbor

   babel-rxcost:  reception cost calculated for this neighbor; this
      value is usually derived from the Hello history, which may be
      combined with other data, such as statistics maintained by the
      link layer; the rxcost is sent to a neighbour in each IHU

   babel-cost:  link cost is computed from the values maintained in the
      neighbour table: the statistics kept in the neighbour table about
      the reception of Hellos, and the txcost computed from received IHU
      packets

      participate in the enabled security mechanism; any private key
      component of a credential MUST NOT be readable; adding and
      deleting credentials MAY be allowed

   babel-security-trust:  a set of babel-credential-obj objects that
      identify the credentials of routers whose babel messages may be
      trusted or of a certificate authority (CA) whose signing of a
      router's credentials implies the router credentials can be
      trusted, in the context of this security mechanism; how a security
      mechanism interacts with this list is determined by the mechanism;
      a security algorithm may do additional validation of credentials,
      such as checking validity dates or revocation lists, so presence
      in this list may not be sufficient to determine trust; adding and
      deleting credentials MAY be allowed

   babel-credvalid-log-enable:  if true, logging of messages that
      include credentials used for authentication is enabled; if false,
      these messages are not logged; MUST be configurable, if
      implemented babel-credvalid-log: log entries that have the
      timestamp a message containing credentials used for peer
      authentication (e.g., DTLS Server Hello) was received on a Babel
      port, and the entire received message (including Ethernet frame
      and IP headers, if possible); an implementation must restrict the
      size of this log, but how and what size is implementation-
      specific; if this log is implemented, a mechanism to clear it
      SHOULD be provided

Internet-Draft           Babel Information Model            October 2018


3.6.  Definition of babel-routes-obj

        object {
             ip-address           babel-route-prefix;
             int                  babel-route-prefix-length;
             base64               babel-route-router-id;
             string               babel-route-neighbor;
            [int                  babel-route-received-metric;]
            [int                  babel-route-calculated-metric;]
             int                  babel-route-seqno;
             ip-address           babel-route-next-hop;
             boolean              babel-route-feasible;
             boolean              babel-route-selected;
         }babel-routes-obj;

   babel-route-prefix:  Prefix (expressed in IP address format) for
      which this route is advertised

   babel-route-prefix-length:  Length of the prefix for which this route
      is advertised babel-route-router-id: router-id of the source
      router for which this route is advertised

   babel-route-neighbor:  reference to the babel-neighbors entry for the
      neighbor that advertised this route

   babel-route-received-metric:  the metric with which this route was
      advertised by the neighbor, or maximum value (infinity) to
      indicate a the route was recently retracted and is temporarily
      unreachable (see Section 3.5.5 of [I-D.ietf-babel-rfc6126bis]);
      this metric will be 0 (zero) if the route was not received from a
      neighbor but was generated through other means; either babel-
      route-calculated-metric or babel-route-received-metric MUST be
      provided

   babel-route-calculated-metric:  a calculated metric for this route;
      how the metric is calculated is implementation-specific; maximum
      value (infinity) indicates the route was recently retracted and is
      temporarily unreachable (see Section 3.5.5 of
      [I-D.ietf-babel-rfc6126bis]); either babel-route-calculated-metric
      or babel-route-received-metric MUST be provided

   babel-route-seqno:  the sequence number with which this route was
      advertised

   babel-route-next-hop:  the next-hop address of this route; this will
      be empty if this route has no next-hop address

Internet-Draft           Babel Information Model            October 2018


   babel-route-feasible:  a boolean flag indicating whether this route
      is feasible, as defined in Section 3.5.1 of
      [I-D.ietf-babel-rfc6126bis])

   babel-route-selected:  a boolean flag indicating whether this route
      is selected, i.e., whether it is currently being used for
      forwarding and is being advertised

4.  Common Objects

4.1.  Definition of babel-credential-obj

        object {
             credentials          babel-cred;
       }babel-credential-obj;

   babel-cred:  a credential, such as an X.509 certificate, a public
      key, etc.  used for signing and/or encrypting babel messages

4.2.  Definition of babel-log-obj

        object {
             datetime           babel-log-time;
             string             babel-log-entry;
       }babel-log-obj;

   babel-log-time:  the date and time (according to the device internal
      clock setting, which may be a time relative to boot time, acquired
      from NTP, configured by the user, etc.) when this log entry was
      created

   babel-log-entry:  the logged message, as a string of utf-8 encoded
      hex characters

5.  Extending the Information Model

   Implementations MAY extend this information model with other
   parameters or objects.  For example, an implementation MAY choose to
   expose babel route filtering rules by adding a route filtering object
   with parameters appropriate to how route filtering is done in that
   implementation.  The precise means used to extend the information
   model would be specific to the data model the implementation uses to
   expose this information.

Internet-Draft           Babel Information Model            October 2018


6.  Security Considerations

   This document defines a set of information model objects and
   parameters that may be exposed to be visible from other devices, and
   some of which may be configured.  Any mechanism or protocol that is
   used to transmit this information or allow for its configuration is
   also responsible for ensuring this is done so in a secure manner.

   This information model defines objects that can allow credentials
   (for this device, for trusted devices, and for trusted certificate
   authorities) to be added and deleted.  Public keys and shared secrets
   may be exposed through this model.  This model requires that private
   keys never be exposed.  The Babel security mechanisms that make use
   of these credentials are not defined or identified in this model.

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document defines a Babel Link Type registry for the values of
   the babel-link-type and babel-supported-link-types parameters to be
   listed under the Babel Routing Protocol registry.

   Valid Babel Link Type names are normatively defined as

   o  MUST be at least 1 character and no more than 20 characters long

   o  MUST contain only US-ASCII [RFC0020] letters 'A' - 'Z' and 'a' -
      'z', digits '0' - '9', and hyphens ('-', ASCII 0x2D or decimal 45)

   o  MUST contain at least one letter ('A' - 'Z' or 'a' - 'z')

   o  MUST NOT begin or end with a hyphen

   o  hyphens MUST NOT be adjacent to other hyphens

   The rules for Link Type names, excepting the limit of 20 characters
   maximum, are also expressed below (as a non-normative convenience)
   using ABNF [RFC5234].

         SRVNAME = *(1*DIGIT [HYPHEN]) ALPHA *([HYPHEN] ALNUM)
         ALNUM   = ALPHA / DIGIT     ; A-Z, a-z, 0-9
         HYPHEN  = %x2D              ; "-"
         ALPHA   = %x41-5A / %x61-7A ; A-Z / a-z [RFC5234]
         DIGIT   = %x30-39           ; 0-9       [RFC5234]

   The allocation policy of this registry is Specification Required
   [RFC8126].

   The initial values in the "Babel Link Type" registry are:

Appendix A.  Open Issues

   1.  Would it be useful to define some parameters for reporting
       statistics or logs? [2 logs are now included.  If others are
       needed they need to be proposed.]

   Closed Issues:

   1.   Closed by defining base64 type and using it for all router IDs:
        "babel-self-router-id: Should this be an opaque 64-bit value
        instead of int?"

   2.   Closed as "No": Do we need a registry for the supported security
        mechanisms?  [Given the current limited set, and unlikelihood of
        massive expansion, I don't think so.  But we can if someone
        wants it.]

   3.   This draft must be reviewed against draft-ietf-babel-rfc6126bis.
        [I feel like this has been adequately done, but I could be
        wrong.]

   4.   babel-interfaces-obj: Juliusz:"This needs further discussion, I
        fear some of these are implementation details."  [In the absence
        of discussion, the current model stands.  Note that all but
        link-type and the neighbors sub-object are optional; if an
        implementation does not have any of the optional elements then
        it simply doesn't have them and that's fine.]

   5.   Would it be useful to define some parameters specifically for
        security anomalies?  [The 2 logs should be useful in identifying
        security anomalies.  If more is needed, someone needs to
        propose.]

   6.   I created a basic security model.  It's useful for single (or
        no) active security mechanism (e.g., just HMAC, just DTLS, or
        neither); but not multiple active (both HMAC and DTLS -- which
        is not the same as HMAC of DTLS and would just mean that HMAC
        would be used on all unencrypted messages -- but right now the

        model doesn't allow for configuring HMAC of unencrypted messages
        for routers without DTLS, while DTLS is used if possible).  OK?
        [No-one said otherwise.]

   7.   babel-external-cost may need more work. [if no comment, it will
        be left as is]

   8.   babel-hello-[mu]cast-history: the Hello history is formated as
        16 bits, per A.1 of 6126bis.  Is that a too implementation
        specific?  [We also now have an optional-to-implement log of
        received messages, and I made these optional.  So maybe this is
        ok?]

   9.   rxcost, txcost, cost: is it ok to model as integers, since
        6126bis 2.1 says costs and metrics need not be integers.  [I
        have them as integers unless someone insists on something else.]

   10.  For the security log, should it also log whether the credentials
        were considered ok?  [Right now it doesn't and I think that's ok
        because if you log Hellos it was ok and if you don't it wasn't.]

   11.  Should babel link types have an IANA registry?  [Agreed to do
        this at IETF 102.]
